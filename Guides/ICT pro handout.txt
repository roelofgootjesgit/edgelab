## What is ICT?

**ICT** = **Inner Circle Trader** methodology by Michael J. Huddleston

### Core Philosophy

> "The market is NOT random. It's an algorithm designed to accumulate liquidity from retail traders and deliver it to institutional players."

**Key Principles:**

1. **Smart Money** = Banks, hedge funds, market makers
2. **Retail Traders** = You, unless you understand ICT
3. **Liquidity** = Stop losses waiting to be hit
4. **Fair Value** = Where price SHOULD be (gaps get filled)
5. **Institutional Footprints** = Patterns smart money leaves behind

---

## The 11 ICT Concepts

### 🎯 **Category 1: Institutional Levels (Where Smart Money Enters)**

#### 1. Order Blocks (OB)
**What:** Last candle before major move (where institutions accumulated)

**Bullish OB:**
- Last GREEN candle before price drops
- Price returns = support (institutions defending)
- Enter LONG when price touches OB

**Bearish OB:**
- Last RED candle before price rallies
- Price returns = resistance (institutions selling)
- Enter SHORT when price touches OB

**Real Example:**
```
Price: 2000 → 1950 (drop)
Last green before drop: 2005-2010 (Bullish OB)
Price returns to 2008 → BUY (institutions support here)
```

**QuantMetrics Config:**
- `min_candles`: 3 (how many candles before reversal)
- `min_move_pct`: 2.0% (minimum reversal size)
- `validity_candles`: 20 (how long OB stays active)

**When to Use:** After strong moves, expecting retest

---

#### 2. Breaker Blocks (BB)
**What:** Order Block that FAILED (now becomes opposite)

**Bullish Breaker:**
- Was Bearish OB (resistance)
- Price BROKE THROUGH it
- Now becomes SUPPORT
- Enter LONG on retest

**Bearish Breaker:**
- Was Bullish OB (support)
- Price BROKE THROUGH it
- Now becomes RESISTANCE
- Enter SHORT on retest

**Real Example:**
```
Bearish OB at 2050 (should be resistance)
Price breaks ABOVE 2050 → Breaker formed
Price returns to 2050 → BUY (now support, not resistance)
```

**Why It Works:** Failed institutional level = new bias

**QuantMetrics Config:**
- Same as OB + `break_threshold_pct`: 0.2% (how far through to confirm break)

**When to Use:** Trend reversals, failed support/resistance

---

#### 3. Mitigation Blocks (MB)
**What:** Order Block that price RETURNED to and HELD

**Process:**
1. OB forms (e.g., Bullish OB at 2000)
2. Price leaves (goes to 2020)
3. Price returns (back to 2000)
4. Price HOLDS and bounces (confirmed support)
5. = Mitigation Block (higher probability than regular OB)

**Real Example:**
```
Bullish OB: 2000-2005
Price rallies to 2020 (left the zone)
Price drops back to 2003 (returned)
Price bounces from 2003 → 2015 (held)
= Mitigation Block confirmed
Next return to 2000-2005 = HIGH PROBABILITY LONG
```

**Why It Works:** Institutions DEFENDED the level once, will likely defend again

**QuantMetrics Config:**
- `mitigation_validity`: 20 (candles to wait for return)
- `hold_candles`: 2 (candles that must hold after return)

**When to Use:** Looking for BEST quality OB entries

---

### 🎯 **Category 2: Imbalances (Gaps That Get Filled)**

#### 4. Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
**What:** 3-candle gap where middle candle doesn't overlap neighbors

**Bullish FVG:**
```
Candle 1: Low = 2000
Candle 2: Range = 2010-2020 (middle)
Candle 3: High = 2008

Gap: 2000 to 2008 (Candle 3 high < Candle 1 low)
= Bullish FVG (price moved up too fast)
```

**Trading:**
- Price often RETURNS to fill gap
- Enter LONG when price enters bullish FVG (discount)
- Enter SHORT when price enters bearish FVG (premium)

**Real Example:**
```
Strong rally: 2000 → 2050 (left gap at 2010-2015)
Price consolidates at 2050
Price drops to 2012 (enters FVG)
→ BUY (institutions filling gap, expect bounce)
```

**QuantMetrics Config:**
- `min_gap_size`: 0.5 (minimum gap in price points)
- `validity_candles`: 50 (how long gap stays valid)
- `fill_threshold`: 50% (how much of gap must fill)

**When to Use:** After fast moves, expecting retracement

---

#### 5. Imbalance Zones (IZ)
**What:** Similar to FVG but uses ENTIRE candle range (wicks included)

**Difference from FVG:**
- FVG: Body-to-body gap
- IZ: Full range gap (including wicks)

**Example:**
```
Candle 1: Low = 2000
Candle 2: (middle candle, any range)
Candle 3: High = 1995

If Candle 3 high < Candle 1 low → Imbalance Zone
```

**Why It Matters:** Catches gaps FVG might miss

**QuantMetrics Config:**
- Same as FVG
- Usually finds MORE zones than FVG

**When to Use:** Want broader gap detection than FVG

---

### 🎯 **Category 3: Liquidity Concepts (Stop Hunts)**

#### 6. Liquidity Sweep (LS)
**What:** Price breaks swing high/low to grab stops, then REVERSES

**Bearish Sweep (Stop Hunt Above):**
1. Swing high: 2050
2. Retail puts stop ABOVE: 2055
3. Price spikes to 2056 (hits stops)
4. Price REVERSES down
5. = Bearish sweep → Enter SHORT

**Bullish Sweep (Stop Hunt Below):**
1. Swing low: 2000
2. Retail puts stop BELOW: 1995
3. Price spikes to 1994 (hits stops)
4. Price REVERSES up
5. = Bullish sweep → Enter LONG

**Real Example:**
```
Recent low: 2000
Price drops to 1998 (swept stops below 2000)
Price RALLIES back to 2010
→ Bullish sweep confirmed
Expect further upside (retail SHORT, institutions LONG)
```

**QuantMetrics Config:**
- `lookback_candles`: 10 (swing detection period)
- `sweep_threshold_pct`: 0.1% (distance beyond level)
- `reversal_pct`: 0.3% (reversal size to confirm)

**When to Use:** Reversal trading, catching stop hunts

---

#### 7. Inducement (IND)
**What:** FAKE breakout designed to trap retail

**Bullish Inducement (Trap for Longs):**
1. Price breaks ABOVE obvious resistance
2. Retail goes LONG (breakout trade)
3. Price REVERSES down
4. Retail trapped
5. → Enter SHORT (fade the fake breakout)

**Bearish Inducement (Trap for Shorts):**
1. Price breaks BELOW obvious support
2. Retail goes SHORT (breakdown trade)
3. Price REVERSES up
4. Retail trapped
5. → Enter LONG (fade the fake breakdown)

**Real Example:**
```
Resistance: 2050 (tested 3 times)
Price breaks to 2053 (retail: "Breakout! Buy!")
Price DROPS back to 2045
→ Bullish inducement (fake breakout)
Enter SHORT (retail longs trapped, institutions selling)
```

**QuantMetrics Config:**
- `break_threshold_pct`: 0.2% (distance above level for fake breakout)
- `reversal_pct`: 0.5% (reversal size to confirm trap)

**When to Use:** At obvious levels retail watches, for reversals

---

### 🎯 **Category 4: Market Structure (Trend Analysis)**

#### 8. Market Structure Shift (MSS)
**What:** Trend change confirmation (break of structure)

**Bullish MSS (Downtrend → Uptrend):**
1. Downtrend: Lower highs, lower lows
2. Price breaks ABOVE previous swing high
3. = Bullish MSS (trend changed)
4. → Enter LONG (new uptrend started)

**Bearish MSS (Uptrend → Downtrend):**
1. Uptrend: Higher highs, higher lows
2. Price breaks BELOW previous swing low
3. = Bearish MSS (trend changed)
4. → Enter SHORT (new downtrend started)

**Real Example:**
```
Downtrend:
- High 1: 2100
- Low 1: 2050
- High 2: 2080 (lower high)
- Low 2: 2030 (lower low)

Price rallies to 2085 (breaks High 2 at 2080)
→ Bullish MSS confirmed
Enter LONG (downtrend broken, expect uptrend)
```

**QuantMetrics Config:**
- `swing_lookback`: 5 (swing detection period)
- `break_threshold_pct`: 0.2% (distance beyond swing)

**When to Use:** Trend trading, catching reversals early

---

#### 9. Displacement (DISP)
**What:** Fast, aggressive move showing institutional CONVICTION

**Characteristics:**
- 3+ consecutive strong candles (70%+ body)
- Minimal wicks (shows urgency)
- 1.5%+ total move
- = Institutions aggressively entering

**Bullish Displacement:**
- 3 strong green candles
- Total move >1.5% up
- → Expect continuation (institutions buying)

**Bearish Displacement:**
- 3 strong red candles
- Total move >1.5% down
- → Expect continuation (institutions selling)

**Real Example:**
```
Candle 1: 2000 → 2015 (90% green body)
Candle 2: 2015 → 2028 (85% green body)
Candle 3: 2028 → 2040 (80% green body)
Total: +2% in 3 candles
→ Bullish displacement
Enter LONG pullback (institutions committed to upside)
```

**QuantMetrics Config:**
- `min_body_pct`: 60% (how strong each candle must be)
- `min_candles`: 2 (consecutive strong candles)
- `min_move_pct`: 1.0% (total move size)

**When to Use:** Momentum trading, trend continuation

---

### 🎯 **Category 5: Value & Timing (Context)**

#### 10. Premium/Discount Zones (PDZ)
**What:** Where is price relative to recent range?

**Concept:**
- Calculate recent high/low (50 candles)
- Divide into zones (Fibonacci-based)

**Zones:**
- **Premium** (top 38.2%): Price is HIGH → Sell zone
- **Discount** (bottom 38.2%): Price is LOW → Buy zone
- **Equilibrium** (middle 20%): Fair value → Avoid or scalp

**Real Example:**
```
Recent 50 candles:
- High: 2100
- Low: 2000
- Range: 100 points

Discount: 2000-2038 (bottom 38.2%) → BUY zone
Equilibrium: 2038-2062 (middle 20%) → WAIT
Premium: 2062-2100 (top 38.2%) → SELL zone

Current price: 2070 (in premium)
→ Look for SHORT setups (price is expensive)
```

**QuantMetrics Config:**
- `lookback_candles`: 50 (range calculation period)
- `premium_threshold`: 0.618 (61.8% = premium start)
- `discount_threshold`: 0.382 (38.2% = discount start)

**When to Use:** ALWAYS (foundation for all entries)

---

#### 11. Kill Zones (KZ)
**What:** Time windows when institutions are MOST active

**London Kill Zone: 07:00-10:00 UTC**
- Most active session
- Strong directional moves
- Trend continuation common
- Best for breakout/MSS trades

**New York Kill Zone: 12:00-15:00 UTC**
- Second most active
- High volume
- Reversals common (London reaction)
- Best for liquidity sweep/inducement trades

**Asian Kill Zone: 00:00-03:00 UTC**
- Range-bound
- Accumulation/distribution
- Low volatility
- Best for range trades or avoid

**Real Example:**
```
Strategy: Only trade London + NY

07:00 UTC: London opens
→ Look for MSS, displacement, breakouts

12:00 UTC: NY opens
→ Look for sweeps, inducement, reversals

Outside these times: AVOID (low volume, choppy)
```

**QuantMetrics Config:**
- `enabled_zones`: ['london', 'newyork']
- Customizable hours if needed

**When to Use:** ALWAYS (time filter for all strategies)

## How to Combine Concepts

### 🔥 **The ICT Decision Tree**

```
STEP 1: TIMING
↓
Are we in a Kill Zone (London/NY)?
├─ YES → Continue
└─ NO → WAIT

STEP 2: VALUE
↓
Check Premium/Discount Zone
├─ In PREMIUM → Look for SHORT setups
├─ In DISCOUNT → Look for LONG setups
└─ In EQUILIBRIUM → WAIT or scalp only

STEP 3: STRUCTURE
↓
What's the market doing?
├─ MSS occurred → Trend change (follow new direction)
├─ Displacement occurred → Momentum (follow continuation)
└─ Ranging → Look for inducement/sweep (reversals)

STEP 4: ENTRY
↓
Wait for entry trigger:
├─ Order Block retest
├─ FVG fill
├─ Breaker Block retest
├─ Liquidity Sweep
└─ Inducement trap

STEP 5: CONFIRMATION (Optional)
↓
Stack more concepts:
├─ OB + FVG (high probability)
├─ Breaker + Sweep (reversal)
├─ MSS + Displacement (strong trend)
```

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ **Mistake 1: Trading Too Many Concepts**

**Wrong:**
```
Entry: Need MSS + OB + FVG + Sweep + Inducement + Breaker + Premium + Kill Zone
Result: Zero trades (too restrictive)
```

**Right:**
```
Entry: Kill Zone + Premium/Discount + ONE entry concept (MSS OR OB OR Sweep)
Result: 20-40 quality trades
```

**Rule:** MAX 3-4 concepts per strategy

---

### ❌ **Mistake 2: Ignoring Premium/Discount**

**Wrong:**
```
Enter LONG because MSS occurred
(But price is in PREMIUM = expensive)
Result: Low win rate (buying high)
```

**Right:**
```
MSS occurred → Wait for pullback to DISCOUNT → Then LONG
Result: Better entries, higher win rate
```

**Rule:** ALWAYS check value first

---

### ❌ **Mistake 3: Trading Outside Kill Zones**

**Wrong:**
```
Perfect setup at 03:00 UTC (Asian session)
Enter trade anyway
Result: Choppy, low volume, stop hit
```

**Right:**
```
Perfect setup at 03:00 UTC
→ WAIT until 07:00 (London open)
→ Re-evaluate if setup still valid
Result: Better execution, clearer moves
```

**Rule:** Time is as important as price

---

### ❌ **Mistake 4: Chasing Every Signal**

**Wrong:**
```
See 193 Inducement signals
Try to trade all of them
Result: Overtrading, fatigue, losses
```

**Right:**
```
See 193 Inducement signals
Filter: Only during Kill Zones (cut to ~100)
Filter: Only in Premium/Discount zones (cut to ~40)
Trade the best 10-20
Result: Quality over quantity
```

**Rule:** Filter signals, don't trade them all

---

### ❌ **Mistake 5: Not Waiting for Confirmation**

**Wrong:**
```
Order Block identified at 2000
Price approaching 2005
Enter LONG early (anticipating touch)
Result: Price doesn't reach OB, stops to 1998, then rallies
```

**Right:**
```
Order Block at 2000
Wait for price to TOUCH 2000-2002
Enter LONG when candle closes in OB zone
Result: Better fills, confirmed entry
```

**Rule:** Let price COME TO YOU

---

Signal:
- Price drops into OB zone (2662)
- Price also in FVG zone
- = Double support ✓

Entry:
→ LONG at 2663 (OB + FVG confluence)

Exit:
- SL: 2658 (5 points = 1R)
- TP: 2673 (10 points = 2R)

Result:
- Price bounces immediately
- TP hit within 3 hours
- WIN +2R
```

**Why It Worked:**
